#### Project 3: Rock Paper Scissors

You will create a smart contract named Remittance whereby:

Splitter smashed? Remittance roughly done?

You know the drill, deceptively simple, simple first, review, iterate, stretch goals...

What
You will create a smart contract named RockPaperScissors whereby:

Alice and Bob play the classic rock paper scissors game.
to enrol, each player needs to deposit the right Ether amount, possibly zero.
to play, each player submits their unique move.
the contract decides and rewards the winner with all Ether wagered.
Of course there are many ways to implement it so we leave to yourselves to invent.

How can this be the 3rd project and not the 1st?? Try.

Stretch goals:

make it a utility whereby any 2 people can decide to play against each other.
reduce gas costs as much as you can.
let players bet their previous winnings.
